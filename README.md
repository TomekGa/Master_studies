The code used to perform simulations for the master thesis titled "Sexual selection and inbreeding depression in small populations - simulation model".

All scripts are independent and are described in detail in the thesis available [here](https://www.ap.uj.edu.pl/diplomas/121116/).

Sorry for the quality of the coding but that was my beginning with R :).
